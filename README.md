# See Stress
Stress comes from all around us, all the time. With so many causes, it can be overwhelming. SeeStress allows users to easily and neatly visualize their different sources of stress, analyze trends, and offers helpful insights and advice.

## Activity Logging
Users log different activities of their day, rating each with a stress level of 1 - 10. This data is used to get stress trends for each individual user.

## Insights
Based on a user's past and current stress level and trends, personalized and specific advice is given to each user, and insights are offered into different categories and their stress levels. 

### Graph
SeeStress uniquely and innovatively offers visualization of stress data and trends with a graph. The graph contains many different configurations, including bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs.

Users can see trends over time and compare different categories of stress, with different time frames and metrics. All in all, the graph provides a useful visualization of an otherwise un-quantifiable feeling of stress.

## Resources
Our site also links many other resources and pages that provide more resources for any person suffering from stress.
