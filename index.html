<br>
       <p class = "aboutsubtext">  SeeStress is a website dedicated to supporting students and helping them manage stress levels.</p>
       <br>
       <p class = "aboutheader"> Our Mission:</p>
          <br> 
          <p class = "aboutsubtext">In school nowadays, many students are subjected to constant stress from homework, teachers, and tests. At home, they can also experience even more stress from family and other relationships. This stress can have significant negative impact on one's mental health, and our goal is to help students avoid this by providing a service that gives them helpful advice and suggestions based on the stressful activities they input. Additionally, we provide other helpful resources and graphs for students to visualize and reflect on what is causing them the most stress. By aiding in this process of reflection, we hope to improve student mental health.
          </p>
        <p class = "aboutheader"> What services do we provide? </p>  
        <br>
        <p class = "aboutsubtext"> We provide strategies and suggestions on how to manage stress based on activities like tests, social interactions, other things that happens during a regular studentâ€™s day. We also provide outside sources to help students on our "links to help page".
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class = "aboutheader">  Are logged activities shared? </p>
